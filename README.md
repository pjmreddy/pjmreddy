### 🔮 **About Me**  
I engineer AI systems that **think**, **adapt**, and **create**. My work lives at the bleeding edge of generative AI—transforming raw data into contextual intelligence, whether through self-improving LLMs, multimodal agents, or ethical frameworks that tame hallucinations.  

At the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, I’m pioneering low-resource optimization techniques (QLoRA, PEFT) to democratize access to powerful language models. Beyond research, I architect production-grade pipelines that turn theoretical breakthroughs into scalable tools for healthcare, customer support, and beyond.  

*“The future of AI isn’t just models—it’s systems that learn, reason, and evolve with purpose.”*

### 🌟 **Philosophy**  
- **Ethics Meets Efficiency**: Build AI that’s both powerful *and* responsible.  
- **Beyond Benchmarks**: Solve real-world problems—accuracy without applicability is noise.  
- **Open Intelligence**: Advocate for transparent systems that empower, not obscure.

### 🚀 **Let’s Connect**  
- **Collaborate**: If you’re redefining AI’s role in healthcare, enterprise, or creative domains.  
- **Debate**: Ethics of agentic systems, the future of RAG, or transformer scalability.  
- **Build**: Open-source tools that bridge research and real-world impact.
